Python – Overview\\nPython Tutorial \\n        \\n    6 \\n \\nIn this chapter, let\\'s highlight some of the important features of Python that make it widely \\npopular. \\nPython is Easy to Learn \\nThis is one of the most important reasons for the popularity of Python. Python has a limited \\nset of keywords. Its features such as simple syntax, usage of indentation to avoid clutter \\nof curly brackets and dynamic typing that doesn\\'t necessitate prior declaration of variable \\nhelp a beginner to learn Python quickly and easily. \\nPython is Interpreter Based \\nInstructions in any programming languages must be translated into machine code for the \\nprocessor to execute them. Programming languages are either compiler based or \\ninterpreter based.  \\nIn case of a compiler, a mac hine language version of the entire source program is \\ngenerated. The conversion fails even if there is a single erroneous statement. Hence, the \\ndevelopment process is tedious for the beginners. The C family languages (including C, \\nC++, Java, C Sharp etc) are compiler based. \\nPython is an interpreter based language. The interpreter takes one instruction from the \\nsource code at a time, translates it into machine code and executes it. Instructions before \\nthe first occurrence of error are executed. With this fea ture, it is easier to debug the \\nprogram and thus proves useful for the beginner level programmer to gain confidence \\ngradually. Python therefore is a beginner-friendly language. \\nPython is Interactive \\nStandard Python distribution comes with an interactive shell that works on the principle of \\nREPL (Read – Evaluate – Print – Loop). The shell presents a Python prompt >>>. You can \\ntype any valid Python expression and press Enter. Python interpreter immediately returns \\nthe response and the prompt comes back to read the next expression. \\n>>> 2*3+1 \\n7 \\n \\n>>> print (\"Hello World\") \\nHello World \\nThe interactive mode is especially useful to get familiar with a library and test out its \\nfunctionality. You can try out small code snippets in interactive mode before writing a \\nprogram. \\n3. Python – Features\\nPython Tutorial \\n        \\n    7 \\n \\nPython is Multi-Paradigm \\nPython is a completely object -oriented language. Everything in a Python program is an \\nobject. However, Python conveniently encapsulates its object orientation to be used as an \\nimperative or procedural language – such as C. Python also provides certain functionality \\nthat resembles functional programming. Moreover, certain third -party tools have been \\ndeveloped to support other programming paradigms such as aspect -oriented and logic \\nprogramming. \\nPython\\'s Standard Library \\nEven though it has a very few keywords (only Thirty Five), Python software is distributed \\nwith a standard library made of large number of modules and packages.  Thus Python has \\nout of box support for programming needs such as serialization, data compression, \\ninternet data handling, and many more. Python is known for its batteries included \\napproach. \\n \\nPython is Open-Source and Cross-Platform \\nPython\\'s standard distribution can be downloaded from \\nhttps://www.python.org/downloads/ without any restrictions. You can download pre -\\ncompiled binaries for various operating system platforms. In addition, the source code is \\nalso freely available, which is why it comes under open source category. \\nPython softw are (along with the documentation) is distributed under Python Software \\nFoundation License. It is a BSD style permissive software license and compatible to GNU \\nGPL (General Public License).  \\nPython is a cross-platform language. Pre-compiled binaries are available for use on various \\noperating system platforms such as Windows, Linux, Mac OS, Android OS. The reference \\nimplementation of Python is called CPython and is written in C. You can download the \\nsource code and compile it for your OS platform. \\nA Python p rogram is first compiled to an intermediate platform independent byte code. \\nThe virtual machine inside the interpreter then executes the byte code. This behaviour\\nPython Tutorial \\n        \\n    10 \\n \\nStatic vs Dynamic Typing \\nC++ is a statically typed language. The type of variables for storing data need to be \\ndeclared in the beginning. Undeclared variables can\\'t be used. Once a variable is declared \\nto be of a certain type, value of only that type can be stored in it. \\nPython is a dynamically typed language. It doesn\\'t require a variable to be declared before \\nassigning it a value. Since, a variable may store any type of data, it is called dynamically \\ntyped. \\nOOP Concepts \\nBoth C++ and Python implement object oriented programming concepts. C++ is closer to \\nthe theory of OOP than Python. C++ supports the concept of data encapsulation as the \\nvisibility of the variables can be defined as public, private and protected. \\nPython doesn\\'t have the provision of defining the visibility . Unlike C++, Python doesn \\'t \\nsupport method overloading. Because it is dynamically typed, all the methods are \\npolymorphic in nature by default. \\nC++ is in fact an extension of C. One can say that additional keywords are added in C so \\nthat it supports OOP. Hence, we can write a C type procedure oriented program in C++. \\nPython is completely object oriented language. Python \\'s data model is such that, even if \\nyou can adapt a procedure oriented approach, Python internally uses object -oriented \\nmethodology. \\nGarbage Collection \\nC++ uses the concept of pointers. Unused memory in a C++ program is not cleared \\nautomatically. In C++, the process of garbage collection is manual. Hence, a C++ program \\nis likely to face memory related exceptional behavior. \\nPython has a mechanism of automatic garbage collection. Hence, Python program is more \\nrobust and less prone to memory related issues. \\nApplication Areas \\nBecause C++ program compiles directly to machine code, it is more suitable for systems \\nprogramming, writing device drivers, embedded systems and operating system utilities. \\nPython program is suitable for application programming. Its main area of application today \\nis data science, machine learning, API development etc. \\nThe following table summarizes the comparison between C++ and Python: \\nCriteria C++ Python \\nExecution Compiler based Interpreter based \\nTyping Static typing Dynamic typing \\nPortability Not portable Highly portable \\nGarbage collection Manual Automatic\\nPython Tutorial \\n        \\n    i \\n \\nAbout the Tutorial \\nToday, Python is one of the most popular programming languages. Although it is a general-\\npurpose language, it is used in various areas of applications such as Machine Learning, \\nArtificial Intelligence, web development, IoT, and more. This Python tutorial is designed \\nto be a self -learning guide for beginners, students looking for a career in software \\ndevelopment and Data science. This tutorial shall also be useful for experienced software \\nprofessionals to enhance their skills. \\nThis Python tutorial is based on the latest Python 3.11.2 version.  \\nWhat is Python? \\nPython is a very popular general -purpose interpreted, interactive, object -oriented, and \\nhigh-level programming language. Python is dynamically -typed and garbage -collected \\nprogramming language. It was cre ated by Guido van Rossum during 1985 - 1990.
